SkinSight: Early-Stage Skin Cancer Detection App

SkinSight is a mobile application designed to assist in the early detection of skin cancer. It leverages React Native for a smooth user experience across iOS and Android platforms.  A separate detection AI codebase handles the core image analysis, and this repository focuses on the app functionality.

Features:

Image Capture and Upload: Users can capture images of suspicious moles or lesions directly through the app's camera or select photos from their device's gallery.
Secure Storage: Uploaded images are securely stored using Amazon S3 Cloud CDN storage, ensuring data privacy and scalability.
Communication with Detection AI: The app interacts with a separate detection AI codebase (not included in this repository) to process uploaded images and provide insights.
User-Friendly Interface: The app offers a clear and intuitive interface for easy navigation and interaction.
Tech Stack:

Frontend: React Native
Backend: Node.js Express
Database: MongoDB
Storage: Amazon S3 Cloud CDN
Getting Started:

Prerequisites:

Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
A MongoDB database instance running locally or on a cloud provider.
An Amazon S3 bucket configured for secure storage.
The separate detection AI codebase (not included here) integrated with the backend API.
Clone the Repository:

Bash
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
Use code with caution.

 Install Dependencies:

Bash
cd SkinSight
npm install  # or yarn install
Use code with caution.

 Environment Setup:

Create a .env file in the project root directory and configure the following environment variables:

MONGODB_URI=mongodb://your_mongo_host:port/your_database_name
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
# Add any other environment variables required by the detection AI or backend API
 Start the Development Server:

Bash
npm start  # or yarn start
Use code with caution.

 This will start the development server, typically accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser. You can use a mobile emulator or a connected physical device to test the app.

Additional Notes:

This README provides a basic guide for setting up the app. Refer to the respective documentation for React Native, Node.js Express, MongoDB, and Amazon S3 for more detailed configuration instructions.
The integration with the separate detection AI codebase needs to be implemented based on the specific API it provides.
Disclaimer:

SkinSight is intended as an aid in early-stage skin cancer detection and should not be used as a sole means of diagnosis. Please consult a qualified dermatologist for any concerning skin conditions.
